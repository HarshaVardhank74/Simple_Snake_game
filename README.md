# Simple_Snake_game


**Description:**
This classic Snake game is developed using Python's Turtle graphics module. The game features a single-player mode where the player controls a snake that moves continuously in one direction. The goal is to collect as many food items as possible to grow the snake and achieve a high score. 

**Gameplay:**
- The snake starts as a small line segment at the center of the screen.
- The player controls the direction of the snake's movement using A,W,S,D keys (up-W, down-S, left-A, right-D).
- Food items, represented by a small square, appear randomly on the screen.
- Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer, and the score increases.
- The game continues until the snake collides with the wall or with itself, which results in a game over.

**Visuals:**
- The game is played on a simple grid-like screen with a green background.
- The snake is represented by a series of black and red squares, and the food items are white squares.
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen, and the game over message appears when the snake collides.

**Key Features:**
- **Simple Controls:** The snake is controlled using A,W,S,D key inputs.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** As the snake grows longer, the game becomes more challenging due to the increased risk of collision.
- **Score Tracking:** The current score is updated in real-time, encouraging players to beat their previous high scores.

**Target Audience:** 
This game is perfect for beginners who are learning Python and want to explore game development using the Turtle module. Itâ€™s also enjoyable for players who appreciate classic arcade-style games with simple mechanics.
